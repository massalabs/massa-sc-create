# Create a Massa's smart contract from template ðŸŽ‰

This repository is not meant to be used, moved or updated. If you're looking for the Massa's smart contract standard library, you better look at [`massa-sc-std`](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-std).

The purpose of the current repository is to allow the user to create a Massa's smart contract project with a development environment setup in one command:

```shell
npx massa-sc-create hello-world
```

This will basically clone [`massa-sc-template`](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-template) and customize default project values.
